He studied jurisprudence at Prague and Graz, and in\n1857 became a teacher at the latter university. He published several\nhistorical works, but soon gave up his academic career to devote\nhimself wholly to literature. For a number of years he edited the\ninternational review, <em>Auf der Hohe</em>, at Leipzig, but later removed to\nParis, for he was always strongly Francophile. His last years he spent\nat Lindheim in Hesse, Germany, where he died on March 9, 1895. In 1873\nhe married Aurora von Rumelin, who</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">wrote a number of novels under the\npseudonym of Wanda von Dunajew, which it is interesting to note is the\nname of the heroine of <em>Venus in Furs</em>. Her sensational memoirs which\nhave been the cause of considerable controversy were published in 1906.</p><p>During his career as writer an endless number of works poured from\nSacher-Masoch's pen. Many of these were works of ephemeral journalism,\nand some of them unfortunately pure sensationalism, for economic\nnecessity forced him to turn his pen to unworthy ends.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There is, however, a residue among his works which has a distinct\nliterary and even greater psychological value. His principal literary\nambition was never completely fulfilled. It was a somewhat\nprogrammatic plan to give a picture of contemporary life in all its\nvarious aspects and interrelations under the general title of the\n<em>Heritage of Cain</em>. This idea was probably derived from Balzac's\n<em>Comedie Humaine</em>. The whole was to be</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">divided into six subdivisions\nwith the general titles <em>Love, Property, Money, The State, War,</em> and\n<em>Death</em>. Each of these divisions in its turn consisted of six novels,\nof which the last was intended to summarize the author's conclusions\nand to present his solution for the problems set in the others.</p><p>This extensive plan remained unachieved, and only the first two parts,\n<em>Love</em> and <em>Property</em>, were completed. Of the other sections only\nfragments remain. The present novel, <em>Venus in Furs</em>, forms the fifth\nin the series, <em>Love</em>.</p><p>The best of Sacher-Masoch's work is characterized by a swift\nnarration and a graphic representation of character and scene and a\nrich humor. The latter has made many of his shorter stories dealing\nwith his native Galicia little masterpieces of local color.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There is, however, another element in his work which has caused his\nname to become as eponym for an</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">entire series of phenomena at one end\nof the psycho-sexual scale. This gives his productions a peculiar\npsychological value, though it cannot be denied also a morbid tinge\nthat makes them often repellent. However, it is well to remember that\nnature is neither good nor bad, neither altruistic nor egoistic, and\nthat it operates through the human psyche as well as through crystals\nand plants and animals with the same inexorable laws.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sacher-Masoch was the poet of the anomaly now generally known as\n<em>masochism</em>. By this is meant the desire on the part of the individual\naffected of desiring himself completely and unconditionally subject to\nthe will of a person of the opposite sex, and being treated by this\nperson as by a master, to be humiliated, abused, and tormented, even\nto the verge of death. This motive is treated in all its innumerable\nvariations. As a creative artist Sacher-Masoch was, of course, on the\nquest for</p>",

Sacher-Masoch has not created anything\nnew in this. He has simply taken an ancient motive and developed it\nfrankly and consciously, until, it seems, there is nothing further</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to\nsay on the subject. To the violent attacks which his books met he\nreplied in a polemical work, <em>�ber den Wert der Kritik</em>.</p><p>It would be interesting to trace the masochistic tendency as it occurs\nthroughout literature, but no more can be done than just to allude to\na few instances. The theme recurs continually in the <em>Confessions</em> of\nJean Jacques Rousseau; it explains the character of the chevalier in\nPr�vost's <em>Manon l'Escault</em>. Scenes of this nature are found in Zola's\n<em>Nana</em>, in Thomas Otway's <em>Venice Preserved</em>, in Albert Juhelle's <em>Les\nPecheurs d'Hommes</em>, in Dostojevski. In disguised and unrecognized form\nit constitutes the undercurrent of much of the sentimental literature\nof the present day, though in most cases the authors as well as the\nreaders are unaware of the pathological elements out of which their\ncharacters are built.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In all these strange and troubled waters of the</p>",

Laurent Tailhade has an admirable passage in his <em>Platres et\nMarbres</em>, which is well worth reproducing in this connection:</p><p>\"Toutefois, les Hell�nes, dans, leurs cit�s de lumi�re, de douceur\net d'harmonie, avaient une indulgence qu'on peut nommer scientifique\npour les troubles amoureux de l'esprit. S'ils ne regardaient pas\nl'ali�n� comme en proie a la visitation d'un dieu (id�e orientale et\nfataliste), du moins ils savaient que l'amour est une sorte\nd'envo�tement, une folie o� se manifeste l'animosit� des puissances\ncosmiques. Plus tard, le christianisme enveloppa les �mes de\nt�n�bres. Ce fut la grande nuit. L'�glise condamna tout ce qui lui\npar�t neuf ou mena�ant pour les dogmes impla�able qui reduisaient le\nmonde en esclavage.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Among Sacher-Masoch's works, <em>Venus in Furs</em> is one</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">of the most\ntypical and outstanding. In spite of melodramatic elements and other\nliterary faults, it is unquestionably a sincere work, written without\nany idea of titillating morbid fancies. One feels that in the hero\nmany subjective elements have been incorporated, which are a\ndisadvantage to the work from the point of view of literature, but on\nthe other hand raise the book beyond the sphere of art, pure and\nsimple, and make it one of those appalling human documents which\nbelong, part to science and part to psychology. It is the confession\nof a deeply unhappy man who could not master his personal tragedy of\nexistence, and so sought to unburden his soul in writing down the\nthings he felt and experienced. The reader who will approach the book\nfrom this angle and who will honestly put aside moral prejudices and\nprepossessions will come away from the perusal of this book with a\ndeeper understanding of this poor miserable soul of ours and a</p>",

When several years ago\ncheap reprints were brought out on the Continent and attempts were\nmade by various guardians of morality—they exist in all countries\n——to have them suppressed, the judicial decisions were invariably\nagainst the plaintiff and in favor of the publisher. Are Americans\nchildren that they must be protected from books which any European\nschool-boy can purchase whenever he wishes?

In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.</p>",

He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.</p><p>\"But enough of that.

There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign <em>camere ammobiliate</em>.

  "page-181": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">open.</p><p>\"Why so late?\" she asks.</p><p>\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly.

It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Now—\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought.
