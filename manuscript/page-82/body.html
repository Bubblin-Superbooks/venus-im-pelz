foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is
likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We
are such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,
part fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other
anvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down
upon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only
do when she is cruel towards me."</p><p>"But, Severin," replied Wanda, almost angrily, "do you believe me
capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?"</p><p>"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? <em>It is possible to
love really only that which stands above us,</em> a woman, who through her
beauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us
and becomes a despot over us."</p></div> </div>
