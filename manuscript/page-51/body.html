<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">white figure, the woman of stone whom I
adore, whom I fear and flee.</p><p>With a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and
reflect.</p><p>What am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?</p><p>A sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,
yet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading
in the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers
into beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.</p><p>There is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my
book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.</p><p>A woman's dress—</p><p>She is there—Venus—but without furs—No, this time it is merely
the widow—and yet—Venus-oh, what a woman!</p></div> </div>
