<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">at night. All
the time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen
to what she said, accompany her wherever she went.</p><p>My love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I
subside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me
from it.</p><p>This afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the
Venus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she
wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.</p><p>Suddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became
confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing
command over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,
and she—she drew me close to her heaving breast.</p><p>"Are you angry?" I then asked her.</p><p>"I am never angry at anything that is natural—" she replied, "but
<em>I</em> am afraid you suffer."</p></div> </div>
