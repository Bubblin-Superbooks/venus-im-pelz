following morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still
filled with a pleasant half darkness.</p><p>"Is it you, Gregor?" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,
building a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I
cannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the
four-poster bed.</p><p>"Yes, my mistress," I reply.</p><p>"How late is it?"</p><p>"Past nine o'clock."</p><p>"Breakfast."</p><p>I hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.</p></div> </div>
