<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>As she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her
slight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor
small; her head is alluring, piquant—in the sense of the period of the
French marquises—rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and
softness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her
skin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through
everywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How
abundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow—how
diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes
meet mine like green lightnings—they are green, these eyes of hers,
whose power is so indescribable—green, but as are precious stones, or
deep unfathomable mountain lakes.</p><p>She observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I
have remained seated and still have my cap on my head.</p></div> </div>
