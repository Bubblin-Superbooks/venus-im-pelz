painter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and
cheese.</p><p>Night has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and
legs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the
affair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face
like Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German
song.</p><p>"Now that all the shadows gather
 And endless stars grow light,
 Deep yearning on me falls
 And softly fills the night."</p><p>"Through the sea of dreams
 Sailing without cease,
 Sailing goes my soul
 In thine to find release."</p><p>And I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal
comfort among her soft furs.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
