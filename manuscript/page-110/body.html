from behind half-closed lids.</p><p>"Give me the whip."</p><p>I looked about the room.</p><p>"No," she exclaimed, "stay as you are, kneeling." She went over to
the fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching
me with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled
up the sleeve of her fur-jacket.</p><p>"Marvellous woman!" I exclaimed.</p><p>"Silence, slave!" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me
with the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and
pityingly bent down to me. "Did I hurt you?" she asked, half-shyly,
half-timidly.</p><p>"No," I replied, "and even if you had, pains that come through you
are a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure."</p><p>"But it doesn't give me pleasure."</p></div> </div>
