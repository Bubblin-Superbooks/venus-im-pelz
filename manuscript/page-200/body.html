the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.</p><p>Haydee thereupon leaves.</p><p>"Hand me the sleeping-furs," says Wanda, sleepily stretching her
lovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she
slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself
down on the cushions of the ottoman.</p><p>"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers."</p><p>I kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.

will teach you." She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is
off.</p><p>"Now get out!" Still a kick—and then I can go to bed.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
