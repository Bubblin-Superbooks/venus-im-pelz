of white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she
wears a scarlet <em>kazabaika</em>, richly edged with ermine. Upon her
powdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with
her arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.</p><p>"Wanda!" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to
kiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.</p><p>"Slave!"</p><p>"Mistress!" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.</p><p>"That is as it should be."</p><p>"Oh, how beautiful you are."</p><p>"Do I please you?" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at
herself with proud satisfaction.</p><p>"I shall become mad!"</p></div> </div>
