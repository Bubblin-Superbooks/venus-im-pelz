awoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.</p><p>How much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I
actually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped
was certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red
stripes on my body. And <em>she</em> whipped me. Now I know everything.</p><p>My dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I
disappointed in the realization of my dream?</p><p>No, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.
Oh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the
remotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What
happiness to be her slave!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
