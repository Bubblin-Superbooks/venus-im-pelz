<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Florence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda
chooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.</p><p>"What have I a servant for," she says, "Gregor—here is the ticket—
get the luggage."</p><p>She wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I
drag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a
moment under the last one; a good-natured <em>carabiniere</em> with an
intelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.</p><p>"It must be heavy," said she, "all my furs are in it."</p><p>I get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my
brow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his
horse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated
entrance.</p><p>"Have you any rooms?" she asks the portier.</p><p>"Yes, madame."</p><p>"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves."</p></div> </div>
