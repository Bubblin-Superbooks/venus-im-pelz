<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">you sacrifice our entire
future to a whim?"</p><p>"It is no longer a whim," she exclaimed.</p><p>"What is it?" I asked frightened.</p><p>"Something that was probably latent in me," she said quietly and
thoughtfully. "Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had
not called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a
powerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that
I cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out—
you—are you a man?"</p><p>"Dear, sweet Wanda!" I began to caress her, kiss her.</p><p>"Don't—you are not a man—"</p><p>"And you," I flared up.</p><p>"I am stubborn," she said, "you know that. I haven't a strong
imagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up
my mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,
the more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!"</p></div> </div>
