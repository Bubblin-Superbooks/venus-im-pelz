suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in
Furs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and
strikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind
me, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a
dark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.</p><p>Then the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings
in the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.</p><p>I have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf
about to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,
without any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It
would be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to
death before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe
I am beginning to hate this woman.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
