<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">with me to-day," and when I was
about to sit down opposite her, she added, "No, over here, close by
my side."</p><p>She is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me
with her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten
and flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who
serves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is
only now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of
countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn
out of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,
and, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before
Wanda leaps up in a rage.</p><p>"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you
like her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I am frightened; I have never seen her like this</p></div> </div>
