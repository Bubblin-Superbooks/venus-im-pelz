<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and
fever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the
power of a heartless, affronted woman.</p><p>Well, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have
no wish to go on living.</p><p>As I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning
over the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her
green eyes sparkle.</p><p>"Still alive?" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed
head.</p><p>"Give me back my poinard," she continued. "It is of no use to you.
You haven't even the courage to take your own life."</p><p>"I have lost it," I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.</p><p>She looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.</p><p>"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?" She shrugged her shoulders. "No
matter. Well, and why didn't you leave?"</p></div> </div>
