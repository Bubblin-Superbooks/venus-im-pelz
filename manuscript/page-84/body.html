<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>We are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant
summer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of
climbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable
stars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am
sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her
of my childhood.</p><p>"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked
in you?" asked Wanda.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in
my cradle, so mother has told me, I was <em>supersensual.</em> I scorned the
healthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.
As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was
only an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed
by the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually
afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints.</p></div> </div>
