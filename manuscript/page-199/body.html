understand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the
way of a small woman's hand.</p><hr class="section"><p>After dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the
stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and
with a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.
I open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater
I leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,
which trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,
and then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she
receives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with
rage.</p><p>It is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the
last time.</p><p>"Fire!" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, "Tea!"</p></div> </div>
