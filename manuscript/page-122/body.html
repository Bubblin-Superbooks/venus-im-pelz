<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"My friend has complained about you," said Wanda to-day.</p><p>"Perhaps she feels that I despise her."</p><p>"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?" exclaimed
Wanda, pulling my ears with both hands.</p><p>"Because she is a hypocrite," I said. "I respect only a woman who is
actually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake."</p><p>"Like me, for instance," replied Wanda jestingly, "but you see,
child, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither
be as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is
always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to
enchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the
desire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against
her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality
and corrupt her character."</p></div> </div>
