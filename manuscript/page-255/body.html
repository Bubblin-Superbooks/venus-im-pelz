clenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly
withdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful
face.</p><p>But she did not awaken.</p><p>I gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,
and rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.</p><p>She moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how
long I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone
by horrible torments.</p><p>Finally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My
tears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat
up; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.</p><p>"Severin," she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.</p><p>I was unable to reply.</p></div> </div>
